I can't help but think that some of the characters in The Elder Scrolls are in fact the "imaginary friends" or "idealized self-images" of other characters brought to life by magic/The Numidium/mythopoeic force. I once had the weird idea that Dagoth Ur was effectively Nerevar's "imaginary friend" or something like it. He may have imagined up Dagoth Ur, perhaps out of loneliness as Nerevar seemed to not have many friends at first outside of King Dumac, possibly Kagrenac, Sotha Sil, Vivec The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.

There's some speculation that TESVI will be called Redfall based on legal filings made by the same people who copyrighted the names for previous TES games. I'm trying to predict what the game might be about. Following the teaser trailer, the consensus was that we were looking at the region of Hammerfell. Much of the speculation has focused around the fall of the Third Empire a.k.a. the Mede Empire. It makes sense as Red is the color of the Empire, and the Empire is severely weakened. Cyrodiil.

In all my studies in Morrowind, Skyrim, and Hammerfell, the idea of a simple problem ruining a great work seems preposterous, and yet all too common. Let us not forget, in the XVI Accords of Madness that it was Sheogorath's small bird who challenged Hircine's Were-Daedroth and won! Let us not forget it was a lowly prisoner who ran headlong into the Oblivion Gate outside of Kvatch, slew the Daedra, and helped our last, possibly greatest, Septim Emperor defeat Mehrunes Dagon! And so, after. Directed by Todd Howard. With Jeff Baker, Jonathan Bryce, Lynda Carter, Linda Canyon. The protagonist travels by Morrowind, eastern province of Septim Empire in Tamriel. He can save it from enslavement or explore for personal purposes.
