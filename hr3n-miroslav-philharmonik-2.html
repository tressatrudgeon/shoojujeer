What library would fit my needs the most for making Pop music and Movie/Video Games scoring? I've heard that Miroslav Philharmonik Orchestra where used on the entire Lana del Rey's - Born to die Album and that's quit a record but other says it's very limited. Also since I'm studying Vide game scoring full time I'm probably also going to but Spitfire Albion One and I think that will cover a lot of my needs for Movie and Video Game Scoring so Pop and more regular would be the priority.

So far I've used the factory library of Kontakt 5 for orchestral stuff but I saw that Miroslav Philharmonik 2 has a neat crossgrade offer + spring sale which brings the price down from €610 to €185. Has someone here used MP2 and if so, do you think it would be worth the price above? I can't afford huge professional-grade libraries nor have the RAM to use those (I have 8GB and Eastwest Hollywood Orchestra recommends 16GB while 8 seems to be the bare minimum).

I recently started making videogame music digitally, mostly orchestral and acoustic. My first few pieces were made using free VSTs from around the web, but I started to become frustrated by the low quality of most of my instrument samples, and I decided to upgrade. However, I was working on a tight budget, so I couldn't afford to spend £300+ on a full general-purpose library from Native Instruments, EastWest, etc. It turned out that finding a full sampled instrument library in the lt£200.

Я знаю, что волна фото с работ прошла и всех достала. Тем более, фото моего фейса не будет, оно никому не впёрлось, а вот написать про свою работу и увлечение меня уже просили целых 8 подписчиков. Я им обещал, поэтому ПИШУ! (Я даже на старой пикабе этим не занимался) А писать я буду про разные аспекты работы с оркестровой музыкой и вообще о жизни в театре. amp#x200B; Сегодня расскажу об инструмен. ではさっそく、 AmpliTube 3 FREE をダウンロードして、新しいカスタム・ショップでの買い物をお楽しみください。. 
I bought an iRig HD2 last week and as I was registering it, I realized how much was missing from the version of Amplitude 4 that comes "free" with the purchase of the iRig HD2. I started searching for reviews and whatnot (I'm a complete guitar noob, having only been playing for 2mo) of the more costly Amplitude versions and happened upon the fact that IK is having a pretty amazing deal through the end of March; all software and apps are priced at the "upgrade" price point which averages Orchestral Tools Berlin Symphonic Harps KONTAKT. There has been one beautiful, shimmering sound missing in our Berlin Series so far: The Harp. The wait is over - we went back to the Teldex Scoring Stage. Hey guys, I'm pretty sure this isn't explicitly the place for this question but I've had a great experience with the people here so I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm currently using MTpower drums, I've yet to find a better free vst than this one but if you know of a good one, do recommend it. I'd love to try more out. Currently my Snare, drumamptoms and cymbals are on separate tracks with their own EQ's. I'm satisfied with everything but the cymbals, I cannot get them to sound decent. There are plugins with 16 instruments like Miroslav Philharmonik and EZ Drummer. How to mix those instruments? I don't like to open 8 Philharmoniks 20ms delay between pressing a key on my controller and hearing the virtual instrument isn't a dealbreaker, but it does mess with my head quite a bit. Is that a typical kind of time? Any way I can optimize it, perhaps by going through midi cords to my interface, which connects via thunderport vs the controller's usb output? I already have my buffer set as low as I can get it without distortion. ampnbsp; Gear: Arturia Keylab 88 controller connecting via USB Rok Box MC m10 laptop, which. I need a VSTI for some bread and butter strings, choirs, orchestral VST that is: - less than 0 - simple - lush and gorgeous So far the candidates are Garritan Personal Orchestra and IK Multimedia Miroslav Philharmonik 2 CE. Authenticity matters less than sound quality as I'm not composing classical music, I just want better strings to backup my tunes. THANKS. Title kind of says it all, I want to be able to make my own sound tracks but because I obviously can't afford an entire orchestra I'd rather have the flexibility of a "digital orchestra", I've recently been using Miroslav Philharmonik but just can't figure out how to use the thing (so if anyone knows of any tutorial videos that help explain how to actually make sound tracks there that would be great!), and I just feel like maybe theres a more modern software that is more powerful and just easier. 
I started producing a few months ago and this is what I got with some $ leftover. FL Studio 12 Signature Edition Akai MKII Serum Miroslav Philharmonik Sylenth1 both Realdrumsamples.com bundles. I need violin with short attack, or without attack ( 0 ms ), and long sustain ( note lasts whole time when I hold key ). I have Miroslav Philharmonik, but it doesn't have it. Do you know some vsti or sample library it took us a year, but we finally finished our studio that we've been building. we built the studio in a warehouse, here's a link to the post showing some of the construction of the room ( I unloaded the lumber of the delivery truck almost exactly one year ago. It's taken one year to get to this point. After the construction, finishing, layout, and constant cleaning, it was almost two months of cabling, wiring, testing, and constant cleaning. Hi! My name is Sottaceti, and I'm working on a horror game called Astral. I've had it in "development" since 2011, and it's seen many changes. I've already reached a point where I have an entire introductory level planned out, but I need a team to help me out. I have a lot of experience with writing; I've even written me own mum's papers for college and earned her perfect scores (least I could do for the lady for takin' care of my ass). I have a negligible amount of experience with 3D modeling. 
I would definitely make use of the brass and woodwind samples but strings is most important to me for my music. I want to save as much money as I can, but if there's a big difference in the quality I'm happy to pay more.

I've been subscribing to this channel for quite some time and haven't posted anything, so I felt like I could share what I think every beginning producer should know. And I also added some resources that I think are really helpful. When I got into producing EDM I bought Ableton Live because I had a friend who was using it. I bought the standard version (349 €) because I thought an external synth plugin would be better than Ableton Suite's Analog and Operator. But now I realise. (If this is the wrong sub please let me know where I need to go. Thanks!). i recently tried out the ableton trial since i wanted to jump ship from the sinking fl boat. unfortunately i encoutered the problem of some of my VSTs (miroslav philharmonik being the biggest) not even appearing. this is a common problem i've noticed but all the forums i looked up just spammed blurry answers. hopefully I try to install the program and I get this error: Feature: Miroslav Philharmonik VST Component: VST File: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steinberg\ Error: Access is denied EDIT: I tried to fix it by taking the VST from the installer.
