This Netgear N150 Wireless ADSL2+ Modem Router DGN1000 is aimed at the funding ADSL marketplace. The current adapter I have, the Netgear WNA1100 N150, isn't working as well as it used to anymore and I'm getting frequent disconnects and interruptions; I'm assuming from a combination of old age and - since I recently moved and have a different set up around the house - its further from my router/modem now (and I don't have the space or ports to relocate that either), so I'm gonna have to replace the adapter on my PC.

So I have an EDIMAX EW-7811Un N150 ( which works fine with my WGR614v9 (https://www.netgear.com/support/product/WGR614v9) router. The download/upload speeds are fine. Also, according to the driver/OS, I have "full signal" (so all bars are full). However, my wireless ping is between 450-750! When I play on a wired connection, it is only between 35-75. Therefore, my question is, would upgrading only the adapter be good enough?. Date: 02/27/2018: Version: 1030.27.0901.2017 WHQL Driver: Yes Provider: Realtek Semiconductor Corp.
