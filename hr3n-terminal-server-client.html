Has anyone been able to get a custom virtual channel DLL to work with any RDP managers (RDCMan, Terminals, Royal, mRemoteNG, etc)? We have a custom virtual channel DLL that will ONLY work with mstsc.exe. It appears the DLL is not even being loaded by the RDP managers, yet is by mstsc.exe. The DLL is added to HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default\AddIns on the client. Is there a way to force the custom DLL to be loaded with the manager software.

Hello Guys I posted this question a month ago but reposting for further comment/assistance. I'm currently trying to work out an issue with Cookies not being retained when users are closing their IE browser. We use UPM v5.2 on Server 2008 R2 with VDA 7.6. We are mirroring Cookies in our UPM policy. Can someone advise on why cookies would be removed if IE is closed? It's also quite strange as some cookies are being retained as I can see them in the users AppData\Roaming Profile. Also can someo. Hi, I work part-time for a company that has used an old-school Lynx-based terminal for remote data entry for presumably many years, I'm assuming since at least the 80's. It's not great, but worked okay once you figured out how to use it. Recently they decided to update it to a web-based version, and instantly said everyone has to start using this new version ASAP, with the max time limit to do so being by this weekend. I finally started using it tonight and I was curious about the `.faces`. So I've been searching for about two days for a solution to this particular problem, and while there seem to have been similar issues, none have worked for me. I'm able to log into the remote computer just fine, but once I'm in, everything but the icons are black. The desktop is black, the taskbar is black, and whatever window there is in the middle of the screen is black other than the icons on there. This can be seen in the link below. I've manually set my connection. As the title says, she wants to be able to access the shares on the terminal server from her phone, and edit them with the MS Office Apps.

Let me know if you guys need anymore information, or I wasn't clear about my issue. Thanks. My remote desktop connection program no longer works like it should. As of today, it times out after saying "configuring remote session" for a minute or two, after i hit the connect button.

I have an older Steamlink I dont use anymore but wondering if there is a way to setup a Hypervisor with windows 7 for work on it and have a steam link in my office that connects to the hypervisor or virtual workstation outside of having to install steam on the VM?

If user1 and user2 connect to VM1 at the same time, will they see each others changes or will LTSP create separate desktops.
